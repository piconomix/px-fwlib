7.1 STM32 Flashing LED Example {#STM32_EX_FLASHING_LED}
=======================================================

This is a basic GPIO example using **px-lib**. It is the embedded equivalent of 
a "hello world" program on a PC to kick the tires and know that your development
setup works.

The LED flashes at a slow 1 Hz.
