Introduction {#SCORPION_BOARD_EXAMPLE_GPIO_INTRO}
===========================================================

This is a minimal GPIO example for the Scorpion Board. It is the embedded 
equivalent of a "hello world" program on a PC to kick the tires and know that 
your development setup works. The LED is on while the user button is being 
pressed and off while the button is released.
